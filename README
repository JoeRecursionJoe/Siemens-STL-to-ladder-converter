# STL to Ladder Converter

#### Mission statement

Siemens S5 PLC are obsolete. The STL language they are written in can be difficult to understand if you are more familiar with ladder logic.  My hopes is to create a STL to ladder converter in particular Controllogix plc. **As this project will be daunting and I am working on it in my spare time, I welcome all contributors.**

My initial thoughts are to paste in STL text and parse the equivalent ladder logic in various formats, that can be imported into ControlLogix.

At this point I am unsure of which language to choose, but I am leaning towards Python. I am currently in Phase 1.

#### Phase 1

Create a sample list of STL vs Ladder to get an idea of how to proceed.

#### Phase 2

Write function(s) that take input text written in STL and generate corresponding ladder.

#### Phase 3

Create unit tests.

#### Phase 4

Automate multiple network/rung iterations.
