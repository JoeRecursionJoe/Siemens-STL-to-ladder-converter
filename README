My hopes is to create a STL to ladder converter in particular Controllogix plc. My initial thoughts are to paste in STL text and it will parse the equivalent ladder logic in neutral format.

As this project will be an ongoing one and I am working on it in my spare time, I welcome all contributors.

My first task will be to create a sample list of inputs and outputs to get an idea of how to proceed.

At this point I am unsure of the language, but I am leaning towards Python because of its availability.
